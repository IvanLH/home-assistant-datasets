# Assist LLM Training

See generation/device-actions.ipynb for the script to create the dataset. The
dataset focuses on function calling for a fairly large context window and a
reasonably sized tool list as compared to other tool datasets that have
limited numbers of available tools.


The `llama31_unsloth.ipynb` [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/blob/main/train/llama31_unsloth.ipynb) can fine tune a LLama3.1 8B model
on the function calling dataset generated by the above notebook. This can be
run in a Google Colab T4 runtime.
