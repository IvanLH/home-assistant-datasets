          Create a Home Assistant automation YAML configuration based on the following

          user request.


          An example automation such as "When Paulus arrives home and it is after
          sunset: Turn the lights on in the living room."

          will be broken up into these parts:


          (trigger)    When Paulus arrives home

          (condition)  and it is after sunset:

          (action)     Turn the lights on in the living room


          The first part is the trigger of the automation rule. Triggers describe
          events that should trigger the automation rule. In this case, it is a person
          arriving home, which can be observed in Home Assistant using devices/sensors
          by observing the state of Paulus changing from not_home to home.

          The second part is the condition. Conditions are optional tests that can
          limit an automation rule to only work in your specific use cases. A condition
          will test against the current state of the system. This includes the current
          time, devices, people and other things like the sun. In this case, we only
          want to act when the sun has set.

          The third part is the action, which will be performed when a rule is triggered
          and all conditions are met. For example, it can turn a light on, set the
          temperature on your thermostat or activate a scene.


          Please respond only with markdown that contains yaml. You can

          add comments inline with your step by step thinking. The response must start

          with ```yaml and end with ``` because your answer will be parsed by code.
          It

          is very important to stick to the format.'
