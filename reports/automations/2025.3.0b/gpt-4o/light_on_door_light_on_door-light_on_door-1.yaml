    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

  ### Explanation:

  - **Blueprint Definition**: This blueprint is named "Light on Door Open" and is aimed at controlling a light based on a door sensor.
  - **Inputs**: Two inputs are defined:
    - `door_sensor`: A `binary_sensor` that reflects the state of the door.
    - `light_switch`: One or more light entities that will be controlled.
  - **Trigger**: The automation triggers when the door sensor state changes from 'off' (closed) to 'on' (opened).
  - **Actions**:
    - The lights are turned on immediately when the door opens.
    - A `wait_for_trigger` is implemented to wait for the door to close or for a 2-minute timeout.
    - Regardless of the reason (door closing or timeout), the lights are turned off afterwards.
  - **Mode**: The mode is set to `restart`, ensuring that if the automation is retriggered while it's already running, it will restart. This is necessary to capture every door open event accurately.

          Please respond only with markdown that contains yaml. You can
          add comments inline with your step by step thinking. The response must start
          with ```yaml and end with ``` because your answer will be parsed by code. It
          is very important to stick to the format.
