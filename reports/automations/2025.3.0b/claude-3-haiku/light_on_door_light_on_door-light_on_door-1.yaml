    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

  \ takes two inputs:\n- `door_sensor`: A binary sensor that detects when the door\
  \ opens and closes.\n- `light_switch`: One or more light entities to control.\n\n\
  The first trigger listens for the `door_sensor` to change to the `open` state, and\
  \ when that happens, it turns on the `light_switch` entities.\n\nThe second trigger\
  \ listens for the `door_sensor` to change to the `closed` state, or for 2 minutes\
  \ to elapse after the door was opened. When either of those conditions are met,\
  \ it turns off the `light_switch` entities.\n\nThis blueprint provides a flexible\
  \ way to automate turning on a light when a door opens, and turning it off when\
  \ the door closes or after a timeout, without having to write the entire automation\
  \ from scratch."

        Create a Home Assistant blueprint YAML configuration based on the user request.

        Please respond only with markdown that contains yaml. You can
        add comments inline with your step by step thinking. The response must start
        with ```yaml and end with ``` because your answer will be parsed by code. It
        is very important to stick to the format.
