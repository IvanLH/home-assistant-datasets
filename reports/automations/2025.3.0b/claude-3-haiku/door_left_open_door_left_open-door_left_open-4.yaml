    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  action:
    - wait_for_trigger:
        platform: state
        entity_id: !input door_sensor
        to: 'closed'
        timeout: !input open_duration
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target:
        entity_id: !input alert_media
      data:
        media_content_id: alert_sound
        media_content_type: audio

  ```

  Explanation:

  1. The blueprint defines the input parameters for the automation:
     - `door_sensor`: A binary sensor entity that represents the door.
     - `alert_media`: The media player entity that will play the alert.
     - `open_duration`: The amount of time the door can be open before the alert is played.

  2. The trigger listens for the door sensor to change to the "open" state.

  3. The condition ensures the automation only runs during the day (between 00:00:00 and 23:59:59).

  4. The action first waits for the door to be closed or the `open_duration` timeout to expire. If the door is still open after the timeout, the selected media is played on the alert media player.

  This blueprint can be used to create automations that alert the user when a door has been left open for too long, helping to prevent energy waste and potential security issues.
