    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

    platform: state
    entity_id: !input door_sensor
    to: 'open'

  condition:
    condition: time
    after: '{{ now().timestamp() + as_timestamp(strptime(''00:00:00'', ''%H:%M:%S'')) - as_timestamp(strptime(''00:00:{{ ((as_timestamp(now()) - as_timestamp(trigger.to_state.last_changed)) / 60) | int }}'', ''%H:%M:%S'')) > 0 }}'

  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target: !input alert_media
      data:
        media_content_id: "alert"
        media_content_type: music
  ```

  The key steps in this blueprint are:

  1. Define the input parameters for the blueprint:
     - `door_sensor`: The binary sensor entity for the door.
     - `alert_media`: The media player and media ID to play the alert on.
     - `open_duration`: The duration the door can be open before the alert plays.

  2. Set up the trigger to watch for the door sensor state changing to "open".

  3. Add a condition to check if the door has been open for longer than the specified `open_duration`.

  4. If the condition is met, play the specified `alert_media` on the target media player.

  This blueprint can be used to alert on any door sensor, with configurable alert media and duration before the alert is triggered.
