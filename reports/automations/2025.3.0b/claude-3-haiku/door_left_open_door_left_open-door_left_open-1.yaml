    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

    condition: time

  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      data:
        media_content_id: !input alert_media
        media_content_type: music
      target:
        entity_id: !input alert_media
    - wait_for_trigger:
        platform: state
        entity_id: !input door_sensor
        to: 'closed'
        for: !input open_duration
    - service: media_player.play_media
      data:
        media_content_id: !input alert_media
        media_content_type: music
      target:
        entity_id: !input alert_media
  ```

  This blueprint creates an automation that listens for the door sensor to go into the 'open' state. Once the door has been open for the specified duration, it will play the selected media on the specified media player. Once the door is closed, it will play the media again to indicate the door has been closed.

  The key points are:

  1. It takes 3 inputs: the door sensor, the media player and media ID to use for the alert, and the duration that the door can be open before the alert is triggered.
  2. It triggers when the door sensor goes into the 'open' state.
  3. It waits for the specified duration using the `wait_for_trigger` action.
  4. It plays the alert media on the specified media player.
  5. It plays the alert media again once the door is closed to indicate the door has been secured.

  This allows the user to customize the door sensor, the alert media, and the duration before the alert is triggered to suit their specific needs.

        Please respond only with markdown that contains yaml. You can
        add comments inline with your step by step thinking. The response must start
        with ```yaml and end with ``` because your answer will be parsed by code. It
        is very important to stick to the format.
