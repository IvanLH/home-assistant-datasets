          # Light on door

          ## Problem statement

          Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

          ## Example use cases

          These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

          - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

          ## Detailed Description

          The blueprint should accept two inputs:

          | Input          | Description                                                                     |
          | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
          | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
          | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

          The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
          light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

          Create a Home Assistant blueprint YAML configuration based on the user request.

          Please respond only with markdown that contains yaml. You can
          add comments inline with your step by step thinking. The response must start
          with ```yaml and end with ``` because your answer will be parsed by code. It
          is very important to stick to the format.
