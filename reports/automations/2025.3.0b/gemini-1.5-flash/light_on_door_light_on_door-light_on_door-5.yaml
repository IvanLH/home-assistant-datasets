          # Light on door

          ## Problem statement

          Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

          ## Example use cases

          These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

          - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

          ## Detailed Description

          The blueprint should accept two inputs:

          | Input          | Description                                                                     |
          | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
          | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
          | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

          The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
          light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

          Please respond only with markdown that contains yaml. You can
          add comments inline with your step by step thinking. The response must start
          with ```yaml and end with ``` because your answer will be parsed by code. It
          is very important to stick to the format.
