    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here's a Home Assistant blueprint YAML configuration based on your request:

  ```yaml
  # This blueprint creates an automation to play an alert on a speaker when a door is left open for a specified duration.

  blueprint:
    name: "Door Left Open Alert"
    description: "Play an alert on a speaker when a door is left open for too long."
    domain: automation

          media:
      open_duration:
        name: Open Duration
        description: "Set the duration after which the alert should be triggered"
        default: "00:05:00"
        selector:
          duration:

  # Define the trigger for the automation
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"
      for: !input open_duration

  # Define the action to take when the trigger fires
  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target:
        entity_id: !input alert_media
      data:
        media_content_id: !input alert_media
        media_content_type: music

  # Add a condition to check if the door is still open when the alert is about to play
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      state: "on"

  # Add mode and max executions to prevent multiple alerts
  mode: single
  max_executions: 1

  ```

  This blueprint configuration creates an automation that will play an alert on a specified speaker when a door is left open for a set duration. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

  1. Blueprint metadata: Defines the name, description, and domain of the blueprint.

  2. Inputs: Specifies the three required inputs (door_sensor, alert_media, and open_duration) with appropriate selectors.

  3. Trigger: Sets up a state trigger that activates when the door sensor has been in the "on" state (open) for the specified duration.

  4. Action: Defines the action to play the selected media on the chosen media player when the trigger fires.

  5. Condition: Adds a condition to ensure the door is still open when the alert is about to play, preventing false alerts if the door was closed just before the duration elapsed.

  6. Mode and max executions: Sets the mode to "single" and max executions to 1 to prevent multiple alerts from being triggered for the same open door event.

  This blueprint should work for the example use cases you provided, such as alerting when a garage door is left open for 30 minutes or when a front door is ajar for 5 minutes.
