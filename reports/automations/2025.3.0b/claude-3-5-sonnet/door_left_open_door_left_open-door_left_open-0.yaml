    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

    This blueprint creates an automation that monitors a specified door sensor.
    If the door is left open for the specified duration, it will play an alert
    on the selected media player. The automation runs in single mode to prevent
    multiple alerts while the door remains open.
  ```

  This blueprint configuration addresses all the requirements you specified:

  1. It accepts three inputs: `door_sensor`, `alert_media`, and `open_duration`, with the correct selector types.
  2. The trigger is set to activate when the door sensor state changes to "on" (open) and remains in that state for the specified duration.
  3. The action plays the selected media on the chosen media player when the trigger conditions are met.
  4. A condition is added to ensure the door is still open when the alert is about to play, preventing false alarms if the door was closed just before the duration expired.
  5. The automation runs in single mode to prevent multiple alerts while the door remains open.
  6. Error handling is included to retry the action if it fails.
  7. Comments are added to explain the purpose and functionality of the blueprint.

  This blueprint can be easily customized for various use cases, such as monitoring different doors and using different speakers or alert sounds.
