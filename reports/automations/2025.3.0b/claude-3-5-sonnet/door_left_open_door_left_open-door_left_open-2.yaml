    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

          data:
            media_content_id: !input alert_media
            media_content_type: "music"
        # Optional: You can add a delay and repeat the alert if needed
        # - delay: "00:05:00"
        # - condition: state
        #   entity_id: !input door_sensor
        #   state: "on"

  # You can add mode: single here if you want to prevent multiple instances of this automation running simultaneously
  # mode: single
  ```

  This blueprint creates an automation that will trigger an alert when a door is left open for a specified duration. Here's a breakdown of the configuration:

  1. The blueprint metadata section defines the name, description, and input parameters for the blueprint.

  2. The `door_sensor` input allows the user to select a binary sensor entity for the door.

  3. The `alert_media` input uses the media selector to allow the user to choose both the media player and the sound to play.

  4. The `open_duration` input lets the user specify how long the door should be open before triggering the alert.

  5. The automation trigger is set up to activate when the door sensor state changes to "on" (open) and remains in that state for the specified duration.

  6. The action uses the `media_player.play_media` service to play the selected alert on the chosen media player.

  7. Optional commented-out sections show how you could add a delay and repeat the alert if the door is still open.

  8. An optional `mode: single` setting can be added to prevent multiple instances of this automation from running simultaneously.

  This blueprint provides a flexible solution for alerting when a door is left open, allowing users to customize the door sensor, alert sound, media player, and duration as needed.
