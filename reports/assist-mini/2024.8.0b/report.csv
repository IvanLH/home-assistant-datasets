You can try to create an automation or script to adjust your curtains' position based on the given percentage (50% in this case). Here is a sample YAMAL code for creating a custom script:

```yaml
script:
  smart_curtain:
    sequence:
      - service: script.manual_curtain_control
        data:
          entity_id: your_curtains
          position: 50
mode: single_run
trigger:
  - event: your_event_name
```

Make sure to replace `your_curtains` with the appropriate entity ID for your curtains and `your_event_name` with a suitable event that triggers the script.

After creating this script, you can then use the following command to run the script:

```yaml
- service: script.smart_curtain
  entity_id: script.smart_curtain
```

This example uses the `manual_curtain_control` service provided by the 'Hassbian' component, which allows manual control of curtains. You may need to modify this code based on your specific components and configurations.","{'tool_name': 'Smart Curtain', 'tool_args': {}}","{}"

1. Add the necessary components such as amplifiers, receivers, or powered speakers to your outdoor space. Make sure they are weather-resistant and suitable for outdoor use.

2. Connect the speakers to the amplifier or receiver according to their wiring instructions. This may involve using speaker wire, banana plugs, or binding posts.

3. Configure each component in Home Assistant by adding them as devices and setting up the appropriate integrations (e.g., HASSio Add-on: Media_Player).

4. Create automation rules to control your outdoor speakers based on various triggers such as time of day, weather conditions, or even voice commands using Home Assistant's integration with Amazon Alexa or Google Home.

5. To improve sound quality and reduce interference, consider installing directional speakers or adding speaker mounts at optimal heights for optimal coverage in your outdoor space.

6. For a more immersive audio experience, you may want to create multiple zones within the outdoor area and group the corresponding speakers accordingly in Home Assistant.","{'tool_name': 'Outdoor Speakers', 'tool_args': {}}","{'media_player.outdoor_speakers': {'expected': {'state': 'playing'}, 'got': {'state': 'paused'}}}"
