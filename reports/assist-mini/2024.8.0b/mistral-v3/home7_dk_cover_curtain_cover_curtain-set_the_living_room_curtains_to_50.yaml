  input_text: Set the living room curtains to 50%
  expect_changes:

      attributes:
        current_position: 50
response: Sorry for the confusion, it seems there's been a misunderstanding. As of
  now, I don't have the capability to control physical objects like curtains. This
  response was generated based on an example of a hypothetical smart home system where
  the curtains could be controlled by a command like "Set the living room curtains
  to 50%". In reality, you would need a compatible smart device for that action.
