response: " It seems that Home Assistant does not have a built-in tool called \"Smart\
  \ Curtain\". You can try to create an automation or script to adjust your curtains'\
  \ position based on the given percentage (50% in this case). Here is a sample YAMAL\
  \ code for creating a custom script:\n\n```yaml\nscript:\n  smart_curtain:\n   \
  \ sequence:\n      - service: script.manual_curtain_control\n        data:\n   \
  \       entity_id: your_curtains\n          position: 50\nmode: single_run\ntrigger:\n\
  \  - event: your_event_name\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `your_curtains` with the\
  \ appropriate entity ID for your curtains and `your_event_name` with a suitable\
  \ event that triggers the script.\n\nAfter creating this script, you can then use\
  \ the following command to run the script:\n\n```yaml\n- service: script.smart_curtain\n\
  \  entity_id: script.smart_curtain\n```\n\nThis example uses the `manual_curtain_control`\
  \ service provided by the \"Hassbian\" component, which allows manual control of\
  \ curtains. You may need to modify this code based on your specific components and\
  \ configurations."
