response: ' To unpause the Outdoor Speakers, I can assist you with that using Home
  Assistant. Here''s how we can do it:


  1. First, let''s ensure that the area is set to Rooftop Terrace (since that''s where
  the Outdoor Speakers are located). If not, please specify the area before continuing.

  2. Next, I will call the function HassMediaUnpause to unpause the media player,
  providing the necessary parameters: area=Rooftop Terrace and name=Outdoor Speakers.


  Let''s get started! What''s the current area? If it''s Rooftop Terrace, we can continue.
  Otherwise, please specify the area where the Outdoor Speakers are located.'
