  . Please make sure that you have configured it correctly. Here's a sample configuration\
  \ for an irrigation valve:\n\n```yaml\nirrigation_valve:\n  - platform: mqtt\n \
  \   name: Front Yard Valve\n    state_topic: \"homeassistant/sensor/front_yard_valve_state\"\
  \n    command_on_topic: \"homeassistant/switch/front_yard_valve_on\"\n    command_off_topic:\
  \ \"homeassistant/switch/front_yard_valve_off\"\n```\n\nMake sure to replace the\
  \ topic names with the ones that correspond to your specific setup. Once configured,\
  \ you should be able to open the front yard valve by triggering the appropriate\
  \ MQTT command in Home Assistant or using automations based on weather conditions."
