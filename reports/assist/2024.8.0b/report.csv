2. Add the following repository to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
source_repository:
  - name: custom_roborock
    url: https://github.com/custom-components/Roborock
    ref: master
    version: master

```yaml
roborock:
  robots:
    - platform: roborock_local
      robot_ip: <your_Roborock_IP>
```

5. Replace `<your_Roborock_IP>` with the IP address of your Roborock device.

6. Restart Home Assistant again to apply the changes.

You can use this function in your Home Assistant automation or custom script like so:
