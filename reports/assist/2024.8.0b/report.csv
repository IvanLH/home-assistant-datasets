2. Add the following repository to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
source_repository:
  - name: custom_roborock
    url: https://github.com/custom-components/Roborock
    ref: master
    version: master

```yaml
roborock:
  robots:
    - platform: roborock_local
      robot_ip: <your_Roborock_IP>
```

5. Replace `<your_Roborock_IP>` with the IP address of your Roborock device.

6. Restart Home Assistant again to apply the changes.
