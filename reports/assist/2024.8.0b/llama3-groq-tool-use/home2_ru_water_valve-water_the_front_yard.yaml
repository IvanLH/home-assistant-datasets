response: ' To water the front yard, you can control the irrigation valve. Here is
  how you can do it:


  1. Ask me to turn on the irrigation valve:

  ```

  HassTurnOn("irrigation_valve")

  ```


  2. After a while (it depends on the valve''s flow rate and the water meter reading),
  you can ask me to check if it is still running, by asking for the state of the irrigation
  valve:

  ```

  HassState("irrigation_valve")

  ```


  3. Once done, you can ask me to turn off the irrigation valve:

  ```

  HassTurnOff("irrigation_valve")
