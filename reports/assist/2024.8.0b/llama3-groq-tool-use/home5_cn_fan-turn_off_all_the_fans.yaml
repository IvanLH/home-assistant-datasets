response: " It seems like there is no tool named \"\" in Home Assistant. You might\

  \        - fan.bedroom_ceiling\n        - fan.living_room_ceiling\n        - fan.kitchen_ceiling\n\
  \        # Add more fan entities as needed\n```\n\nIn this example, I am using a\
  \ time-based trigger that turns off all the fans every night at 11:00 PM (23:00).\
  \ Replace the fan entity IDs with the appropriate ones for your setup."
