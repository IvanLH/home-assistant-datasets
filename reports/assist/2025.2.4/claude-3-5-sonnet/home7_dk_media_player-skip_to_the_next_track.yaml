          text: Certainly! I understand you want to skip to the next track on the
            media player. Based on the information provided, we have one media player
            in the smart home system, which is the Outdoor Speakers on the Rooftop
            Terrace. I'll use the HassMediaNext function to skip to the next track
            for you.
