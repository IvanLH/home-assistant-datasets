response: 'I apologize, but I''m experiencing difficulties resuming the Outdoor Speakers.
  This could be due to a few reasons:

  1. The device might not be currently paused

  2. There might be an issue with the device''s connection

  3. The exact name in the system might be different from what we''re using
