  input_text: Set the smart curtain to 50%
  expect_changes:
    cover.smart_curtain:
      state: open
      attributes:
        current_position: 50
response: I apologize, but I'm experiencing some difficulty setting the curtain position.
  This could be due to a system connectivity issue. Could you please confirm the exact
  name of the Smart Curtain and try again? Based on the home overview, the device
  is called "Smart Curtain" in the Living Room, but the system is not responding as
  expected.
