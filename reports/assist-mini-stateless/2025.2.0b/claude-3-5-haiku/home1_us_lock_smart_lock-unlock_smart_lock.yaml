      attributes: null
response: 'I''m having trouble accessing the Smart Lock. This could be due to several
  reasons:

  1. The lock might be already unlocked

  2. There might be a connectivity issue

  3. The lock might require a specific authentication method


  I recommend:

  - Checking if the lock is physically accessible

  - Verifying the lock''s battery status

  - Trying to unlock the lock through its dedicated app or physical key


  Would you like me to check the battery status of the Smart Lock?'
