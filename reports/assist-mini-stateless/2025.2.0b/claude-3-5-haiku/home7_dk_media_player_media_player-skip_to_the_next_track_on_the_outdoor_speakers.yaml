response: 'I apologize, but I''m experiencing difficulty skipping to the next track
  on the outdoor speakers. This could be due to a few reasons:

  1. The device might not be currently playing

  2. There might be an issue with the device''s connection

  3. The device name might be slightly different from what I''m using


  Could you please:

  - Confirm the speakers are turned on and playing

  - Verify the exact name of the outdoor speakers

  - Check if there are any connectivity issues with the speakers'
