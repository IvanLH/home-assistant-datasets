  A dataset built form the Home Assitant intents repo, modeled after existing
  NLP test cases for the assistant pipeline. This is mean to reuse the
  tests that already exist for the NLP, which turns out to expose some
  weaknesses of the LLMs and the currently exposed Home Assitant intent tools
  that the NLP has heuristics for. It also is a very large home which is
  challenging for smaller models given the ~100 or so devices.
