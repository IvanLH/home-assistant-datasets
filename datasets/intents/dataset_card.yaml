  A dataset built form the Home Assitant intents repo, modeled after existing
  NLP test cases for the assistant pipeline. This is mean to reuse the
  tests that already exist for the NLP, which turns out to expose some
  weaknesses or differences of interpretation of tasks. It also is a very large
  home which is challenging for smaller models given the ~100 or so devices. Lastly,
  there are some tests that have subtle mismatches that are reasonable (e.g.
  "minimium brightness" tests)
