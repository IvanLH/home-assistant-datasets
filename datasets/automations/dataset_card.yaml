  A dataset for evaluating automation generation. The homes for this dataset were
  synthetically generated using gpt-3.5. This dataset is in development and contains
  just a few initial examples. Each benchmark creates a synthetic home fixture
  and configures the entities with a particular state, then asks for an automation
  for a specific set of devices. The benchmark contains a event that should
  trigger the automation, and an expected end state.
