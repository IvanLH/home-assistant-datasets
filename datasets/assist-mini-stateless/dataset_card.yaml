description: |-
  This runs the `assist-mini` dataset, but without entity state information available
  in the prompt. This is a dataset built to exercise the Home Assistant LLM API. The homes
  for this dataset were synthetically generated using gpt-3.5, and then simplified
  for exercising smaller LLMs. The use cases are not intented to be very tricky
  or complicated and aimed at a smaller context window. The number of devices/entities
  in each test is intentionally small (e.g. typically under 5 entities per test)
  to focus on tool calling capabilities rather than context retrieval.
