# device-actions-v2-collect

This dataset is generated by using other assistant pipelines as teachers
from the `deivce-actions-v2` dataset.

The first pass is to use the NLP `assistant` pipeline passing the text through
to generate all the basic commands. All commands that fail are removed from the
output set.

```bash
$ home-assistant-datasets assist collect --dataset ./datasets/device-actions-v2-fixtures/ --model_output_dir=./datasets/device-actions-v2-collect/ --models=assistant
```

The `generatio/device-actions.ipynb` notebook is used to copy out the
succesful sentences and intents.
