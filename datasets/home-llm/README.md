# Home LLM

This dataset is generated from https://github.com/acon96/home-llm but adapted
to call intents rather than services, so that it is compatible with Home Assistant
`assist`. The background is that home-llm was first developed to call services
but then the intent apis were introduced after. The current maintainer of home-llm
[is not prioritizing](https://github.com/acon96/home-llm/discussions/179#discussioncomment-9929556)
improvements.
