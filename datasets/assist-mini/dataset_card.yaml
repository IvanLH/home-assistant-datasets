description: |-
  A dataset built to exercise the Home Assistant LLM API. The homes for this
  dataset were synthetically generated using gpt-3.5, and then simplified for
  exercising smaller LLMs. The use cases are not intended to be very tricky or
  complicated and aimed at a smaller context window. The number of devices/entities
  in each test is intentionally small (e.g. typically under 5 entities per test) to focus
  on tool calling capabilities rather than context retrieval.
